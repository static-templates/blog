Ahoy there, fellow developers! Gather 'round as I spin you a yarn about the wonders of page-based routing. In this digital age, where websites are as common as tumbleweeds in the Wild West, page-based routing is the trusty steed that will guide you through the vast expanse of the internet.

## Creating New Pages with Ease

Picture this: you're building a static site, and you want to create a new page. With page-based routing, it's as easy as lassoing a wild stallion. All you need to do is add a new file or folder to the pages directory, and voila! A new route is born. Just like that, your website gains a new page, ready to be explored by eager visitors.

## Getting Started with Page-Based Routing

Now, let me walk you through the steps of using page-based routing. You have two options to get started. You can either run the `static new folder-name` command, which will create a new folder with the necessary files, or you can create a pages directory in an empty folder. Whichever path you choose, the result is the same: a world of possibilities at your fingertips.

## Mapping Pages to Routes

Each file within the pages directory corresponds to a route on your website. It's like having a map of the digital frontier, with each page marked by a trail. For example, if you have an `about.html` file in the pages directory, it will create a route for the `/about` page. It's as simple as staking claim to a piece of land and giving it a name.

## Organizing Your Routes and Pages

But wait, there's more! Page-based routing offers a wagonload of benefits. It brings order to the chaos of your routes and pages, making it easier to navigate and maintain your site. No more wandering aimlessly through the vast plains of code. With page-based routing, you can corral your pages into neat folders and subfolders, creating a harmonious structure that even the most seasoned cowboy would envy.

## The Power of Static

And that's not all, folks! Page-based routing is just one of the many features offered by the Static framework. It's like having a trusty sidekick by your side, ready to lend a hand. The Static framework also offers layouts, includes, TailwindCSS integration, and collections. It's a whole arsenal of tools to help you tame the wild west of web development.

So saddle up, my friends, and embark on a journey through the world of page-based routing. With its simplicity and power, you'll be able to conquer the digital frontier and create websites that will leave a lasting impression. Remember, the pages are your trails, and the pages directory is your map. Happy coding, pardners!
